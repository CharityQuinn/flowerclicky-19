# flowerclicky-19



This app is designed as a game that asks the user to click a picture to earn points.  If you click a picture twice, you will lose the game.  The pictures will also change position or *shuffle* after every click so you have to remember which picture you clicked.  The app uses **React** and **JSX** as the predominent languages.  

This app has given me a great amount of learning and is very interesting.  I have been helped by my teacher immensely and also by TA's and my tutor.  I am definately excited to learn more about React. I find it very interesting and puzzling.

Here is a links from the app: [Link to front page]("./Flowers List.docx")
